1. Exempt Deployer
Internal Compliance Checklist:
[ ] Verify and Document Eligibility: Internally confirm and document that your business meets all four criteria for the small business exemption (fewer than 50 full-time employees, no use of own data for training, use for intended purpose, and system learning is not based on your data).    

[ ] Review Developer Documentation: Obtain, review, and securely store all documentation provided by the AI system's developer, including statements on purpose, limitations, and risk mitigation.    

[ ] Establish Internal Policy: Create a simple internal policy for employees on the proper and intended use of the AI system, consistent with the developer's guidelines.

[ ] Designate Responsibility: Assign a specific person or team within your organization to handle all consumer inquiries related to AI-assisted decisions.

Compliance Documentation Requirements & AI Agent Elicitation Protocol
As an Exempt Deployer, you are not required to produce formal impact assessments or a public website statement. Your primary "documentation" is a well-defined and consistently executed process for handling consumer inquiries.

Document 1: Consumer Inquiry and Redress Process

Required Information:

A clear, step-by-step process for consumers to follow if they wish to inquire about or contest a decision influenced by the AI system.

Designated contact information (e.g., email address, web form, phone number) for submitting inquiries.

An internal protocol for how your designated team will review and respond to these inquiries.

AI Agent Elicitation Questions:

"What is the exact step-by-step process a consumer should follow to ask about a decision made with the help of the AI system?"

"Please provide the specific contact information (e.g., email address 'AI-inquiry@yourcompany.com', a link to a web form) that consumers should use for these inquiries."

"Describe the internal procedure your team will follow to review a consumer's inquiry. Who is involved, and what information will they review?"

"What information are you prepared to share with a consumer who questions a decision? This will help draft a template response that leverages the documentation provided by the system's developer."

2. General AI System with Disclosure Duty
Internal Compliance Checklist:
[ ] Inventory AI Systems: Identify and create an internal list of all consumer-facing systems that use AI to interact with consumers (e.g., chatbots, virtual assistants, automated email responders).    

[ ] Conduct 'Obviousness' Assessment: For each system, conduct and internally document an assessment of whether a reasonable person would obviously know they are interacting with an AI.    

[ ] Implement Disclosure Mechanism: For any system where the AI nature is not obvious, technically implement the disclosure mechanism so that it is presented clearly and conspicuously at or before the start of the interaction.    

Compliance Documentation Requirements & AI Agent Elicitation Protocol
The only required compliance "document" for this classification is the disclosure itself, along with internal records justifying your decisions.

Document 1: AI Interaction Disclosure

Required Information:

A clear and conspicuous statement informing the consumer they are interacting with an AI system.    

This disclosure must be presented at or before the interaction begins.

Internal Record 1: 'Obviousness' Assessment Justification

Required Information:

A record for each AI system explaining the rationale for why a disclosure is or is not needed.

AI Agent Elicitation Questions:

"For each of your consumer-facing AI systems, please provide its name and primary function."

"Provide the exact text for your AI disclosure statement (e.g., 'You are interacting with an AI assistant.')."

"Describe precisely where and when this disclosure will appear to the user (e.g., 'As the first message in the chat window before the user can type,' or 'In a persistent banner at the top of the interface')."

"If you have determined that a disclosure is not needed for a particular system, provide the detailed justification. Why would a reasonable person find it obvious they are interacting with AI? If there is not obvious reason or you are choosing to add an explicit disclosure, please put N/A."

Question Notes:
If they answer anything except N/A, they don't need to answer the 2nd and 3rd questions. Make sure this is implemented in the questionairre logic. 

3. Developer of High-Risk AI System
Internal Compliance Actions
[ ] Implement 'Reasonable Care' Processes: Establish and document your internal processes for identifying, testing for, and mitigating foreseeable discrimination risks throughout the AI system's lifecycle. This includes conducting fairness audits and adversarial testing.

5. Both Developer and Deployer of High-Risk AI System
Internal Compliance Actions
[ ] Establish Unified Governance: Create a single, integrated Risk Management Policy and Program that governs the entire AI lifecycle, from initial design and data collection through deployment and ongoing monitoring.

[ ] Integrate Workflows: Establish clear internal processes that ensure your 'Deployer' teams have full access to and understanding of the technical details, limitations, and risk assessments produced by your 'Developer' teams.

[ ] Conduct Comprehensive Testing: Perform and document rigorous technical analysis, performance evaluation, and bias testing required of a developer, and use this as a primary input for the Impact Assessments required of a deployer.

[ ] Implement Unified Incident Response: Create a single, streamlined protocol for notifying the Attorney General within 90 days of discovering that the system has caused algorithmic discrimination.

Compliance Documentation Requirements & AI Agent Elicitation Protocol
As a dual-role entity, you must comply with the documentation requirements of both a Developer and a Deployer. While you are not required to generate the formal "Documentation for Deployers" for your own internal use, you must have all of that information readily available to complete your Deployer obligations, such as the Impact Assessment.    

All documents listed under the Developer (3) and Deployer (4) classifications are required. This includes:

Internal Analysis (Equivalent to Developer Documentation for Deployers)

Risk Management Policy and Program

Impact Assessment

Consolidated Public Website Statement (covering both development and deployment)

Consumer Pre-Decision Notice

Adverse Action Notice

AI Agent Elicitation Questions:

For Integrated Governance:

"Describe the process that ensures your deployment teams have full access to the technical limitations and risk assessments produced by your development teams. This will inform the governance section of your documentation."

"How does your organization manage and resolve potential internal conflicts between development goals (e.g., model accuracy) and deployment responsibilities (e.g., fairness, consumer rights)?"

For All Other Documents: 3. Please answer all questions listed in the AI Agent Elicitation Protocol for the Developer of a High-Risk AI System (Section 3). 4. Please answer all questions listed in the AI Agent Elicitation Protocol for the Deployer of a High-Risk AI System (Section 4).
