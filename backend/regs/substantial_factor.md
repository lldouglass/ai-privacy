# Substantial Factor — § 6-1-1701(15)

## Statutory Definition

**"Substantial factor"** means a factor generated by an artificial intelligence system that is used to assist in making, and is capable of altering the outcome of, a consequential decision.

## Context

This definition is critical for determining when an AI system qualifies as "high-risk." An AI system is high-risk if it either:

1. **Makes** a consequential decision, OR
2. Is a **substantial factor in making** a consequential decision

For an AI-generated factor to be "substantial," it must satisfy two requirements:

1. **Used to assist in making** a consequential decision
2. **Capable of altering the outcome** of that consequential decision

## Exclusions

An AI system is **not** high-risk if it only performs narrow procedural tasks or detects decision-making patterns without making recommendations.
