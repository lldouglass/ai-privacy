# Colorado AI Act § 6-1-1703 — Deployer Obligations

## Duty of Care (§ 6-1-1703(1))

A deployer shall use reasonable care to protect consumers from any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination arising from the deployer's intended and contracted uses of the high-risk artificial intelligence system.

A deployer maintains a rebuttable presumption that the deployer has used reasonable care to protect consumers if the deployer complies with the requirements specified in this section.

## Risk Management Policy and Program (§ 6-1-1703(2))

A deployer shall implement a risk management policy and program for any high-risk artificial intelligence system that the deployer deploys, including:

1. Documentation and implementation of policies, procedures, and practices to manage known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination
2. Regular identification, documentation, and mitigation of known or reasonably foreseeable risks
3. Annual review and update of the risk management policy and program

## Impact Assessment (§ 6-1-1703(3))

A deployer shall complete an impact assessment for each high-risk artificial intelligence system prior to deploying the system. The impact assessment must include:

1. A statement of the purpose of the high-risk AI system and its intended use cases, benefits, and deployment context
2. An analysis of whether the deployment of the high-risk AI system poses any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination
3. A description of the categories of data that the high-risk AI system will process and how the data will be collected, used, protected, and retained
4. A description of the deployer's implementation of the risk management policy and program
5. Metrics used to evaluate the high-risk AI system's performance in relation to algorithmic discrimination

The deployer shall make the impact assessment available to the developer that developed the high-risk AI system and, upon request, to the attorney general.

## Public Summaries (§ 6-1-1703(4))

A deployer shall make available on the deployer's website a public summary of each impact assessment that includes:
- The intended use of the high-risk AI system
- How the deployer manages known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination

## Consumer Rights (§ 6-1-1703(5))

When a deployer makes, or is a substantial factor in making, a consequential decision concerning a consumer, the deployer shall provide the consumer:
1. A statement that a high-risk AI system was used in the decision-making
2. Information about the purpose of the high-risk AI system
3. The nature of the consequential decision
4. Contact information for the deployer
5. A statement explaining the right to opt out, where applicable
6. A statement explaining the right to appeal or seek human review

If an adverse consequential decision is made concerning a consumer, the deployer shall provide:
1. A statement of the principal reasons for the decision
2. An opportunity to correct any incorrect personal data
3. An opportunity for the consumer to appeal the decision and receive human review of the decision where technically feasible
