# Deployer — § 6-1-1701(5)

## Statutory Definition

**"Deployer"** means a person doing business in Colorado that deploys a high-risk artificial intelligence system.

## Key Elements

To be considered a "deployer" under the Colorado AI Act, an entity must satisfy two requirements:

1. **Doing business in Colorado** — The person or entity must be conducting business operations within the state
2. **Deploys a high-risk AI system** — The entity actively uses a high-risk artificial intelligence system in making or assisting with consequential decisions

## Important Distinctions

- Deployers use AI systems; they do not necessarily develop them
- An entity can be both a developer and a deployer if they both create and deploy high-risk AI systems
- Only deployers of **high-risk** systems are subject to the Act's deployer obligations

## Exemptions

Certain deployers may be exempt from some or all obligations, including:

- **Small deployers**: Deployers with fewer employees (specific thresholds apply)
- **Regulated industries**: Insurers, banks, and other entities subject to equivalent regulatory frameworks may have modified obligations

See § 6-1-1705 for complete exemption details.

## Applicability

Deployers of **high-risk AI systems** are subject to specific obligations under § 6-1-1703, including:
- Using reasonable care to protect consumers from algorithmic discrimination
- Implementing risk management policies and programs
- Conducting impact assessments
- Providing consumer disclosures and appeal rights
- Making public summaries available

## Related Definitions

- **Developer** (§ 6-1-1701(4)) — the entity that creates or substantially modifies the AI system
- **High-Risk Artificial Intelligence System** (§ 6-1-1701(9)) — triggers deployer obligations
