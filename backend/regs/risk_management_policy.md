# Risk Management Policy and Program — § 6-1-1701(14)

## Statutory Definition

**"Risk management policy and program"** means a documented program, implemented by a deployer, to identify, document, and mitigate known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination arising from the deployer's use of a high-risk artificial intelligence system.

## Key Components

A risk management policy and program is a formal, documented framework that deployers must establish and maintain for each high-risk AI system they deploy. It must include:

1. **Policies, Procedures, and Practices**: Documentation and implementation of specific policies, procedures, and practices to manage known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination

2. **Regular Risk Identification**: Ongoing processes to identify known or reasonably foreseeable risks

3. **Risk Documentation**: Formal documentation of identified risks

4. **Risk Mitigation**: Implementation of measures to mitigate identified risks

5. **Annual Review and Update**: The risk management policy and program must be reviewed and updated at least annually

## Deployer Obligations

Per § 6-1-1703(2), deployers of high-risk AI systems must implement a risk management policy and program as part of their duty of care to protect consumers from algorithmic discrimination.

## Relationship to Impact Assessment

The risk management policy and program is distinct from but related to the impact assessment:

- **Risk Management Policy and Program**: An ongoing operational framework for managing risks across the lifecycle of deployment
- **Impact Assessment**: A documented evaluation completed before deployment and updated as needed

The impact assessment must include a description of the deployer's implementation of the risk management policy and program.

## Compliance Presumption

Deployers that comply with the risk management policy and program requirements (along with other specified requirements) maintain a rebuttable presumption that they have used reasonable care to protect consumers from algorithmic discrimination.
