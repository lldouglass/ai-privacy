# Outcome 2: Exempt Deployer

## Overview

Certain deployers are exempt from some or all obligations under the Colorado AI Act, even if they deploy high-risk AI systems. This outcome applies when a deployer qualifies for one of the statutory exemptions outlined in § 6-1-1705.

## Exemption Categories

### 1. Small Deployer Exemption (Size-Based)

**Statutory Reference**: § 6-1-1705(1)

Deployers with fewer than a specified number of employees may be exempt from certain obligations. The specific thresholds and exempted obligations are:

- Deployers operating with a limited number of employees in Colorado
- The exemption may be full or partial depending on the size threshold met
- Check current regulations for specific employee count thresholds

**What this means**: Small businesses deploying high-risk AI systems may have reduced compliance burdens, though they may still be subject to some basic requirements.

### 2. Regulated Industry Exemptions

**Statutory Reference**: § 6-1-1705

Certain entities subject to equivalent regulatory oversight may be exempt or have modified obligations:

#### Insurance Industry Exemption

- **Insurers** regulated under Colorado insurance laws
- **Fraternal benefit societies** 
- **Developers of AI systems used by insurers**

**Conditions**: The entity must be in full compliance with the Act if the entity is subject to specified laws governing insurers' use of:
- External consumer data and information sources
- Algorithms and predictive models
- Rules adopted by the Colorado Commissioner of Insurance

**What this means**: Insurers and related entities that already comply with insurance-specific AI regulations may be deemed compliant with the Colorado AI Act.

#### Banking and Financial Institution Exemption

- **Banks** regulated by federal or state banking authorities
- **Credit unions**
- **Other financial institutions** subject to prudential regulation

**Conditions**: These entities must be subject to existing regulatory frameworks that govern their use of AI systems and provide equivalent consumer protections.

**What this means**: Federally or state-regulated financial institutions with existing AI oversight may be exempt from duplicative state requirements.

### 3. Government Entity Exemptions

Certain governmental uses of AI systems may be exempt or subject to modified requirements depending on the specific government function and applicable laws.

## What Exempt Deployers Must Still Do

Even exempt deployers may be subject to certain baseline requirements, such as:

- General disclosure requirements for AI interactions (§ 6-1-1704)
- Compliance with anti-discrimination laws
- Cooperation with Attorney General investigations

## How to Determine Exemption Status

To determine if you qualify as an exempt deployer:

1. **Check employee count**: Do you have fewer than the threshold number of employees?
2. **Check regulatory status**: Are you an insurer, bank, credit union, or other regulated entity?
3. **Verify compliance**: If claiming a regulated industry exemption, are you in full compliance with the equivalent regulatory framework?
4. **Consult current regulations**: The Attorney General may issue rules clarifying exemption criteria

## Important Limitations

- Exemptions do not authorize algorithmic discrimination
- Exemptions may be conditional on compliance with equivalent regulations
- The Colorado Attorney General may investigate complaints even for exempt entities
- Exempt status does not provide immunity from other applicable laws (e.g., civil rights laws, consumer protection laws)
