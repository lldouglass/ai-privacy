# Colorado AI Act § 6-1-1701(1) — Algorithmic Discrimination

## Definition

"Algorithmic discrimination" means any condition in which the use of an artificial intelligence system results in an unlawful differential treatment or impact that disfavors an individual or group of individuals on the basis of their actual or perceived:
- Age
- Color
- Disability
- Ethnicity
- Genetic information
- Limited proficiency in the English language
- National origin
- Race
- Religion
- Reproductive health
- Sex
- Veteran status
- Or other classification protected under the laws of Colorado or federal law

## Exclusions from Algorithmic Discrimination

"Algorithmic discrimination" does not include:

1. An act of differential treatment that:
   - Is permissible under state or federal law
   - Is conducted pursuant to a bona fide statistical analysis
   - Is designed to address algorithmic discrimination or prevent algorithmic discrimination
   - Is undertaken pursuant to a self-testing or self-evaluation program

2. An effort to increase diversity or correct for algorithmic discrimination in historical data

3. Lawful differentiation between applicants, participants, or other individuals based on data collected by an entity that does not include any characteristic that is a protected classification

4. Any act conducted by a bona fide not-for-profit private club or other association exempt from requirements under applicable civil rights laws

## Purpose and Context

The duty to protect consumers from algorithmic discrimination applies to "known or reasonably foreseeable risks" arising from the "intended and contracted uses" of a high-risk AI system.

Both developers and deployers are subject to this duty of care and maintain a rebuttable presumption of using reasonable care if they comply with the respective requirements specified in the Colorado AI Act.
