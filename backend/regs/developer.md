# Developer — § 6-1-1701(4)

## Statutory Definition

**"Developer"** means a person doing business in Colorado that develops or intentionally and substantially modifies an artificial intelligence system.

## Key Elements

To be considered a "developer" under the Colorado AI Act, an entity must satisfy two requirements:

1. **Doing business in Colorado** — The person or entity must be conducting business operations within the state
2. **Develops or intentionally and substantially modifies an AI system** — This includes:
   - Creating a new AI system from scratch
   - Making intentional and substantial modifications to an existing AI system

## Important Distinctions

- Minor modifications or customizations may not qualify as "intentionally and substantially modifies"
- Entities that only deploy AI systems developed by others are **deployers**, not developers
- An entity can be both a developer and a deployer if they both create/modify and deploy high-risk AI systems

## Applicability

Developers of **high-risk AI systems** are subject to specific obligations under § 6-1-1702, including:
- Using reasonable care to protect consumers from algorithmic discrimination
- Providing documentation to deployers
- Implementing testing and validation procedures
- Notifying deployers of discovered risks

## Related Definitions

- **Deployer** (§ 6-1-1701(5)) — the entity that uses the AI system
- **High-Risk Artificial Intelligence System** (§ 6-1-1701(9)) — triggers developer obligations
