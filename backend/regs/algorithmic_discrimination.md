# Algorithmic Discrimination — § 6-1-1701(1)

## Statutory Definition

**"Algorithmic discrimination"** means any condition in which the use of an artificial intelligence system results in an unlawful differential treatment or impact that disfavors an individual or group of individuals on the basis of their actual or perceived:

- Age
- Color
- Disability
- Ethnicity
- Genetic information
- Limited proficiency in the English language
- National origin
- Race
- Religion
- Reproductive health
- Sex
- Veteran status
- Or other classification protected under the laws of Colorado or federal law

## Key Elements

For conduct to constitute "algorithmic discrimination" under the Act, it must:

1. **Involve the use of an AI system** — The discrimination must result from using an artificial intelligence system
2. **Result in unlawful differential treatment or impact** — The treatment or impact must be unlawful under Colorado or federal law
3. **Disfavor individuals based on protected characteristics** — The discrimination must be based on actual or perceived protected classifications

## Exclusions from Algorithmic Discrimination

**"Algorithmic discrimination" does not include:**

1. **Lawful differential treatment**, including acts that:
   - Are permissible under state or federal law
   - Are conducted pursuant to a bona fide statistical analysis
   - Are designed to address algorithmic discrimination or prevent algorithmic discrimination
   - Are undertaken pursuant to a self-testing or self-evaluation program

2. **Diversity and remedial efforts**: An effort to increase diversity or correct for algorithmic discrimination in historical data

3. **Lawful non-protected differentiation**: Lawful differentiation between applicants, participants, or other individuals based on data collected by an entity that does not include any characteristic that is a protected classification

4. **Exempt organizations**: Any act conducted by a bona fide not-for-profit private club or other association exempt from requirements under applicable civil rights laws

## Duty of Care Context

The Colorado AI Act imposes a duty of care on both developers (§ 6-1-1702) and deployers (§ 6-1-1703) to protect consumers from **known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination** arising from the intended and contracted uses of high-risk AI systems.

### Reasonable Care Presumption

Both developers and deployers maintain a **rebuttable presumption** that they have used reasonable care to protect consumers from algorithmic discrimination if they comply with the respective requirements specified in the Act.
