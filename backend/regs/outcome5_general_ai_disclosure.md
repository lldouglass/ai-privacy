# Outcome 5: General AI System with Disclosure Duty

## Overview

This outcome applies to entities that deploy or make available AI systems (whether high-risk or not) that are **intended to interact with consumers**. These entities must disclose to consumers that they are interacting with an AI system.

This requirement applies to **all AI systems that interact with consumers**, not just high-risk systems.

## Statutory Requirement

**§ 6-1-1704(1) — General Disclosure Requirement**

Any person or entity that deploys, offers, or makes available an artificial intelligence system that is intended to interact with consumers must disclose that the consumer is interacting with an artificial intelligence system **unless it would be obvious to a reasonable person** that they are interacting with an artificial intelligence system.

## Key Elements

### 1. Who Must Comply

- Any **person doing business in Colorado**
- That **deploys, offers, or makes available** an AI system
- That is **intended to interact with consumers**

This includes but is not limited to:
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- AI-powered customer service systems
- Automated voice systems
- AI systems that generate content for consumers
- Any other AI that directly interacts with consumers

### 2. What Must Be Disclosed

The disclosure must inform the consumer that they are interacting with an artificial intelligence system. The disclosure should be:

- **Clear and conspicuous**
- **Made before or at the time of interaction**
- **Understandable to consumers**

### 3. The "Obvious to a Reasonable Person" Exception

Disclosure is **not required** if it would be obvious to a reasonable person that they are interacting with an AI system.

**Examples where disclosure may not be required:**
- A system explicitly labeled "AI Assistant" or "Bot"
- Interactions where the AI nature is clearly indicated in the user interface
- Situations where the automated nature of the system is unmistakable

**Examples where disclosure IS required:**
- Chatbots that closely mimic human conversation
- AI systems that could be mistaken for human agents
- Any ambiguous interaction where a consumer might not realize they're interacting with AI

## Scope of Application

### Applies To:
- **All AI systems that interact with consumers** (not limited to high-risk systems)
- Systems deployed in any of the eight consequential decision domains
- Systems deployed outside consequential decision domains if they interact with consumers

### Does Not Apply To:
- AI systems that do not interact directly with consumers
- Back-end AI systems used for internal business processes only
- AI systems where consumer interaction is clearly impossible or irrelevant

## Compliance Steps

To comply with this outcome classification:

1. **Identify consumer-facing AI systems**: Determine which of your AI systems interact with consumers

2. **Assess obviousness**: For each system, determine whether it would be obvious to a reasonable person that they're interacting with AI

3. **Implement disclosures**: For systems where it's not obvious, implement clear and conspicuous disclosures

4. **Document decisions**: Keep records of your disclosure decisions and implementations

## Relationship to High-Risk Obligations

This disclosure duty is **separate from and in addition to** the obligations that apply to high-risk AI systems:

- **General AI systems** (Outcome 5): Must disclose AI interaction
- **High-risk AI systems** (Outcomes 7, 8, 9): Must disclose AI interaction PLUS comply with extensive developer/deployer obligations

If your AI system is both consumer-facing AND high-risk, you must comply with both the general disclosure requirement and the high-risk system requirements.

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

Failure to provide required disclosures may constitute a deceptive trade practice under the Colorado Consumer Protection Act (§ 6-1-1706), which can result in:

- Civil penalties
- Attorney General enforcement actions
- Private rights of action by affected consumers

- § 6-1-1704(2)-(3) — Additional disclosures for high-risk systems
- § 6-1-1706 — Enforcement and penalties
- **High-Risk Artificial Intelligence System** (§ 6-1-1701(9)) — For systems that are both consumer-facing and high-risk
