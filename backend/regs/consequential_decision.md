# Consequential Decision — § 6-1-1701(3)

## Statutory Definition

**"Consequential decision"** means a decision that has a material legal or similarly significant effect on the provision or denial to any consumer of, or the cost or terms of:

- Education enrollment or an education opportunity
- Employment or an employment opportunity
- A financial or lending service
- An essential government service
- Health-care services
- Housing
- Insurance
- Legal services

## Context

Consequential decisions are the key trigger for determining whether an AI system is "high-risk" under the Colorado AI Act. An AI system becomes high-risk when it makes, or is a substantial factor in making, a consequential decision.

The determination of whether a decision is "consequential" depends on whether it has a **material legal or similarly significant effect** in one of the eight enumerated domains listed above.
