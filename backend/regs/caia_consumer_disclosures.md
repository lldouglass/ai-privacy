# Colorado AI Act § 6-1-1704 — Consumer Disclosures and Interactions

## General Disclosure Requirement (§ 6-1-1704(1))

Any person or entity that deploys, offers, or makes available an artificial intelligence system that is intended to interact with consumers must disclose that the consumer is interacting with an artificial intelligence system unless it would be obvious to a reasonable person that they are interacting with an artificial intelligence system.

This requirement applies to any AI system (not just high-risk systems) that interacts with consumers.

## Consequential Decision Disclosures (§ 6-1-1704(2))

When a deployer uses a high-risk artificial intelligence system to make, or as a substantial factor in making, a consequential decision, the deployer shall provide the consumer:

1. A statement that a high-risk artificial intelligence system was used to make, or was a substantial factor in making, the consequential decision
2. Information about the purpose of the high-risk AI system
3. The nature of the consequential decision
4. Contact information for the deployer where the consumer can obtain additional information
5. A statement explaining the consumer's rights, including:
   - The right to opt out of the processing, if applicable
   - The right to appeal an adverse decision
   - The right to human review of a decision

## Adverse Decision Rights (§ 6-1-1704(3))

If a deployer makes an adverse consequential decision concerning a consumer that is based in whole or in part on the output of a high-risk artificial intelligence system, the deployer shall provide to the consumer:

1. **Statement of Principal Reasons**: An explanation of the principal reason or reasons for the adverse decision, including the data or data source that was a significant factor in the decision

2. **Right to Correct**: An opportunity for the consumer to correct any incorrect personal data that was processed by the high-risk AI system

3. **Right to Appeal**: An opportunity for the consumer to appeal the adverse decision, which must include:
   - A process for the consumer to contest the adverse decision
   - A process to provide human review of the decision, where technically feasible
   - Information about how to submit an appeal

## Exception for Withholding Information (§ 6-1-1704(4))

To the extent a deployer withholds information based on an exception (such as trade secrets), the deployer shall provide the consumer notice that certain information is being withheld and a statement of the basis for withholding the information.
