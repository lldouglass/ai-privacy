# Impact Assessment — § 6-1-1701(8)

## Statutory Definition

**"Impact assessment"** means a documented evaluation of a high-risk artificial intelligence system and the deployer's use of the system to identify and mitigate known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination.

## Key Components

An impact assessment is a formal, documented process that deployers must complete **prior to deploying** a high-risk AI system. The assessment evaluates both:

1. The high-risk AI system itself
2. The deployer's specific use case and deployment context

## Required Contents

Per § 6-1-1703(3), an impact assessment must include:

1. **Purpose and Use Statement**: The purpose of the high-risk AI system, its intended use cases, intended benefits, and deployment context

2. **Discrimination Risk Analysis**: An analysis of whether the deployment poses any known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination

3. **Data Description**: Categories of data that the high-risk AI system will process and how the data will be collected, used, protected, and retained

4. **Risk Management Implementation**: A description of the deployer's implementation of the risk management policy and program

5. **Performance Metrics**: Metrics used to evaluate the high-risk AI system's performance in relation to algorithmic discrimination

## Disclosure Requirements

Deployers must:

- Make the full impact assessment available to the developer of the high-risk AI system
- Make the full impact assessment available to the Attorney General upon request
- Publish a **public summary** on the deployer's website containing:
  - The intended use of the high-risk AI system
  - How the deployer manages known or reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination

## Timing

Impact assessments must be completed **before** deploying the high-risk AI system and should be updated as the system or its use evolves.
