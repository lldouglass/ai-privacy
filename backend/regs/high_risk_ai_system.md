# High-Risk Artificial Intelligence System — § 6-1-1701(9)

## Statutory Definition

**"High-risk artificial intelligence system"** means any artificial intelligence system that, when deployed, makes, or is a substantial factor in making, a consequential decision.

## Key Elements

An AI system is classified as "high-risk" if it meets two conditions:

1. **When deployed** — The system is actively being used (not just developed or stored)
2. The system either:
   - **Makes** a consequential decision, OR
   - **Is a substantial factor in making** a consequential decision

## Exclusions from High-Risk Classification

### Narrow Procedural Tasks

**"High-risk artificial intelligence system" does not include** an artificial intelligence system that is intended to perform a narrow procedural task or detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns and make no recommendation.

### Technology-Specific Exclusions

The following technologies are **excluded** from the definition of "high-risk artificial intelligence system" **unless** the technology is used to make, or is a substantial factor in making, a consequential decision:

- Anti-fraud technology that does not use facial recognition technology
- Anti-malware, anti-virus, and firewall technology
- Artificial intelligence used solely for the purpose of video game development
- Calculators
- Cybersecurity applications and infrastructure
- Databases and data storage applications and infrastructure
- Internet domain registration and website hosting
- Spell-checking applications
- Spreadsheets
- Web caching or web hosting
- Chatbots subject to an acceptable use policy that prohibits generating content that discriminates or is harmful

### Important Note on Exclusions

These technologies are presumptively not high-risk, but can become high-risk if they are used to make or substantially influence consequential decisions.
